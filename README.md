## Description

Deploy [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) monitoring system using ansible.

## Requirements

- Ansible >= 2.3
- jmespath on deployer machine. If you are using Ansible from a Python virtualenv, install *jmespath* to the same virtualenv via pip.
- gnu-tar on Mac deployer host (`brew install gnu-tar`)

## Role Variables

All variables which can be overridden are stored in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) file as well as in table below.

| Name           | Default Value | Description                        |
| -------------- | ------------- | -----------------------------------|
| `prometheus_version` | 2.2.1  | Prometheus package version. Also accepts `latest` as parameter. |
| `prometheus_config_dir` | /etc/prometheus | Path to directory with prometheus configuration |
| `prometheus_db_dir` | /var/lib/prometheus | Path to directory with prometheus database |
| `prometheus_web_listen_address` | "0.0.0.0:9090" | Address on which prometheus will be listening |
| `prometheus_web_external_url` | "" | External address on which prometheus is available. Useful when behind reverse proxy. Ex. `example.org/prometheus` |
| `prometheus_storage_retention` | "30d" | Data retention period |
| `prometheus_config_flags_extra` | {} | Additional configuration flags passed to prometheus binary at startup |
| `prometheus_alertmanager_config` | [] | Configuration responsible for pointing where alertmanagers are. This should be specified as list in yaml format. It is compatible with official [<alertmanager_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config) |
| `prometheus_global` | { scrape_interval: 60s, scrape_timeout: 15s, evaluation_interval: 15s } | Prometheus global config. Compatible with [official configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file) |
| `prometheus_remote_write` | [] | Remote write. Compatible with [official configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<remote_write>) |
| `prometheus_remote_read` | [] | Remote read. Compatible with [official configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<remote_read>) |
| `prometheus_external_labels` | environment: "{{ ansible_fqdn \| default(ansible_host) \| default(inventory_hostname) }}" | Provide map of additional labels which will be added to any time series or alerts when communicating with external systems |
| `prometheus_targets` | {} | Targets which will be scraped. Better example is provided in our [demo site](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/demo-site/blob/2a8a56fc10ce613d8b08dc8623230dace6704f9a/group_vars/all/vars#L8) |
| `prometheus_scrape_configs` | [defaults/main.yml#L58](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus/blob/ff7830d06ba57be1177f2b6fca33a4dd2d97dc20/defaults/main.yml#L47) | Prometheus scrape jobs provided in same format as in [official docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) |
| `prometheus_config_file` | "prometheus.yml.j2" | Variable used to provide custom prometheus configuration file in form of ansible template |
| `prometheus_alert_rules` | [defaults/main.yml#L58](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus/blob/ff7830d06ba57be1177f2b6fca33a4dd2d97dc20/defaults/main.yml#L58) | Full list of alerting rules which will be copied to `{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/rules/basic.rules`. Alerting rules can be also provided by other files located in `{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/rules/` which have `*.rules` extension |

## Example

### Playbook

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
  - cloudalchemy.prometheus
  vars:
    prometheus_targets:
      node:
      - targets:
        - localhost:9100
        - demo.cloudalchemy.org:9100
        labels:
          env: demosite
```

### Demo site

We provide demo site for full monitoring solution based on prometheus and grafana. Repository with code and links to running instances is [available on github](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/demo-site) and site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).

### Defining alerting rules files

Alerting rules are defined in `prometheus_alert_rules` variable. Format is almost identical to one defined in[ Prometheus 2.0 documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/template_examples/).
Due to similarities in templating engines, every templates should be wrapped in `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` statements. Example is provided in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) file.

## Local Testing

The preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker and [molecule](https://github.com/metacloud/molecule) (v2.x). You will have to install Docker on your system. See Get started for a Docker package suitable to for your system.
All packages you need to can be specified in one line:
```sh
pip install ansible 'ansible-lint>=3.4.15' 'molecule>2.13.0' docker 'testinfra>=1.7.0' jmespath
```
This should be similar to one listed in `.travis.yml` file in `install` section.
After installing test suit you can run test by running
```sh
molecule test --all
```
For more information about molecule go to their [docs](http://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Travis CI

Combining molecule and travis CI allows us to test how new PRs will behave when used with multiple ansible versions and multiple operating systems. This also allows use to create test scenarios for different role configurations. As a result we have a quite large test matrix (42 parallel role executions in case of [ansible-prometheus](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus)) which will take more time than local testing, so please be patient.
